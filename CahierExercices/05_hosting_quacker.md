## Lab 5: Hosting the app

For this third lab, we will share our wonderful app to the world !

First of all, build the project using `npm run build`, wait for the build to finish.

Check that everything is ok inside your configuration json file and deploy the app using `firebase deploy --only hosting`.

Make sure that your website is up and running.
